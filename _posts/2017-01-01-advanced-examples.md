# “Research is something that everyone can do, and everyone ought to do. It is simply collecting information and thinking systematically about it.” - Raewyn Connell

# Collaborative and Independents Research

While my experiences in undergraduate and graduate have been diverse, research has unquestionably been the most important and rewarding component of my education.  Research has proven to be a fantastic supplement to my undergraduate, and graduate-level. Learning to explore and innovate strengthens my conceptual understanding of the material taught in my science classes and leading to an improvement in my academics performance. As I became more involved in research outside of the classroom.

### I. Iris Recognition on IoTs, Embedded, Mobiles Applications ( 01/2021 - Present)

This project aims to ensure robust security for all devices, authorization and authentication are the critically important factor to strongly against the vulnerability or attack from the internet to billions of our embedded mobiles and IoTs devices now much more asynchronously integrated through the internet.

#### Project development of both software and firmware: 

1. In software: 

we propose the novel iris recognition algorithm which is increased the robustness performance to overcome the limitation such as the requirement of the expensive image acquisition devices or requirement of well control environmental conditions, the highly expensive computation using deep learning, and the most important is the adaptable transfer of the algorithm in different applications
+ Novel algorithm proposal.

3. In firmware: 

The first primary open-source hardware platform for the iris recognition, it will serve as the educational platform second it will be the foundation for the future development of iris recognition application in IoTs, and mobiles applications.

+ Embedded system protype for iris recognition

### II. Eye_tracking eLearning Applications ( 09/2020 -- Present)

#### Collaborative Research -- Network Learning Technology (NCU)

This project using advanced algorithm and Custome Design Eye_tracking glass used to calculate the position of the eye and determine exactly where it is focused and what exact the region it focus can be mapped multiple times a second That aim to study visual behavior. 


####  Project development of both Advance Algorithm and Hardware: 

1. Eye_tracking glasses: 

Eye_tracking glasses are ideal for studying behavior in real-world situation. Which can be use objectively and accurately record and analyze visual behavior of human visual behavior, in our study we primary focus on eLearning application eye tracking glass as design demonstrate in figure the crucial important to study movements of participant’s eyes in classroom and event in web browsing and others related of student visual focusing. This gives insight into the cognitive processes underlying a wide variety of student behavior and can reveal things such as learning patters and social interaction, It also allows for the screening of typical neurodevelopment and cognitive or perceptual disability.

+ Normal glasses

+ Outdoor activity Movement glasses

2. Advance Algorithm 

we design app that easy to integrate through different system, that easy for user interact, the user interface that can adapt in multiple language with our current develop me manderine and english 

The eye position is analyized by deep learning algorithm to help use much more easy to analyze data and adpath the chaning in different environment and impact of experiment. 

+ Pupil position tracking and analysis

     You can enable MathJax by setting `mathjax: true` on a page or globally in the `_config.yml`. Some examples:

    [Euler's formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_formula) relates the  complex exponential function to the trigonometric functions.

    $$ e^{i\theta}=\cos(\theta)+i\sin(\theta) $$

    The [Euler-Lagrange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_mechanics) differential equation is the fundamental equation of calculus of variations.

    $$ \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} \left ( \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}} \right ) = \frac{\partial L}{\partial q} $$

    The [Schrödinger equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation) describes how the quantum state of a quantum system changes with time.

    $$ i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi(\mathbf{r},t) = \left [ \frac{-\hbar^2}{2\mu}\nabla^2 + V(\mathbf{r},t)\right ] \Psi(\mathbf{r},t) $$

    ## Code

    Embed code by putting `{{ "{% highlight language " }}%}` `{{ "{% endhighlight " }}%}` blocks around it. Adding the parameter `linenos` will show source lines besides the code.

    {% highlight c %}

    static void asyncEnabled(Dict* args, void* vAdmin, String* txid, struct Allocator* requestAlloc)
    {
        struct Admin* admin = Identity_check((struct Admin*) vAdmin);
        int64_t enabled = admin->asyncEnabled;
        Dict d = Dict_CONST(String_CONST("asyncEnabled"), Int_OBJ(enabled), NULL);
        Admin_sendMessage(&d, txid, admin);
    }

    {% endhighlight %}

    ## Gists

    With the `jekyll-gist` plugin, which is preinstalled on Github Pages, you can embed gists simply by using the `gist` command:

    <script src="https://gist.github.com/5555251.js?file=gist.md"></script>

    ## Images

    Upload an image to the *assets* folder and embed it with `![title](/assets/name.jpg))`. Keep in mind that the path needs to be adjusted if Jekyll is run inside a subfolder.

    A wrapper `div` with the class `large` can be used to increase the width of an image or iframe.

    ## Embedded content

    You can also embed a lot of stuff, for example from YouTube, using the `embed.html` include.

    {% include embed.html url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_C0A5zX-iqM" %}

## My thoughts 

**I believe in innovation and that the way you get innovation is you fund research, Committing myself to the world of scientific research has instilled an investigative mindset and a passion for the scientific process, and an appreciation for the results of engineering design and Innovate.**
