Deep learning techniques have been transformed how mobile and embedded devices interpret and react smarter and efficiency to the world. The growth of the future of machine learning on embedded system and mobile device will need more addition breakthrough in efficient of learning algorithm and hardware development and software development. 
This study will aim try to create the **optimal and efficient learning algorithm** to deploy on **IoT**, **EMBEDDED***, **MOBILE** Devices. 
For machine learning to fulfill its promise in many mobiles and embedded devices there are existing many challenges we need to address. These fundamental challenges include **memory-constrained**, **low latency**, **privacy**, **bandwidth**, **power consumption, and real-time performance, hardware accelerator** and many more. The concept of pushing computing closer to where sensors gather data is a central point of modern embedded systems at the edge of the network. 

We propose **End to end approach computer vision on embedded devices** is a compact **PIPELINE**  deploying advanced deep learning algorithms on edge devices especially for computer vision applications like autonomous vehicles and IoT requires special capabilities.
