Deep learning has been the exponential growth and great attention and tremendous investments on many scientist, laboratories and organization all around the world. 
Furthermore, the existing of mobiles and integrated embedded device more hundreds of billion devices around the worlds. Deep learning techniques have been transformed how mobile and embedded devices interpret and react smarter and efficiency to the world. The growth of the future of machine learning on embedded system and mobile device will need more addition breakthrough in efficient of learning algorithm and hardware development and software development. This study will aim try to create the optimal and efficient learning algorithm to deploy on mobile and embedded system. Neural networks are the core of deep learning, which is a subset of machine learning (ML) and the architecture inspired by the structure of the human brain. They transform an input through a series of comprises of neurons layers, each neuron has a set of weights, and the neurons belonging to different layers are connected. The final layer outputs are the answer, for example, whether an object is recognized or not. In practice, there are two stages of deep learning. 
The first stage of deep learning is training which is when the neural network learns to extract features automatically from the input data. 
The outcome of the training phase is a neural network with weights configured so that it works for the images it was trained on, called the neural network model.
