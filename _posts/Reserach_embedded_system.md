This study proposed the development embedded TDR (Time Domain Reflectometry) system integrated with centrifuge reverse fault physical modeling to simulate sliding at depth to simulate the shear plane in the centrifuge modeling at the different earth gravity levels. 
The prototype model can investigate through the 1/N scale model by enhancing the N time level earth gravity field.
