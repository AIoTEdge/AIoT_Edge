Since September 9/2020, my academic career in Ph.D. research is one of the most important steps for my academic career. My engagement in National Central University’s tech & innovation initiative exercise my creative, my patience, sparked my obsession with design, and strengthened my tolerance to adversity. 
NCU showed me how much what I love to do, what I passionate about, and surrounded me with a wealth of inspiring peers. 

Im so happy to continue my journey in NCU-Delta Machine Learning Vision Research Lab, Im excited to contribute my research efforts as a driven, passionate and exceptional on the design of applications for embedded machine learning, integrate machine learning applications and biometric recognition for security applications.

I’m grateful for these two years away from home, I learned how to articulate my ideas, and discipline myself, and express my thinking and solution for developing and design application that impacts many other people. This time also taught me how much importance of math, physics, and computer science foundation knowledge. One of the most important of my life these two years was a great moment for me working as a team with many excellent and diverse friends from different countries.


## B.S  in Earth Science, earned July/2017

During these four years in The Earth and Planetary Sciences field, I learned how to investigate and gain my experience in encompasses a broad range of science disciplines and applications to environmental and economic endeavors. I’m was lucky to involve in the development and application of new tools and technologies such as space probes and sophisticated instruments, as well as fieldwork in remote and challenging settings. In an unparalleled research environment and monitoring environment.
