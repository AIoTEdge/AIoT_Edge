Since September 9/2020, my academic career in Ph.D. has begun.  My engagement in National Central University’s tech & innovation initiative exercises my creativity, my patience, sparked my obsession with design, and strengthened my tolerance to adversity. 
NCU has shown me, what I love to do, what my passions, and surrounded me with a wealth of inspiring peers. 

I am really happy to continue my journey at NCU-Delta Machine Learning Vision Research Lab. 
Im excited, to contribute my efforts as a driven, passionate and exceptional on the research of development.
My Goals.
#Efficient ML for embedded applications is Integrating ML applications for health care and security((biometric recognition) and civil infrastructure applications on embedded device's l. 
#TinyML is a cutting-edge field that brings the transformative power of machine learning (ML) to the performance- and power-constrained domain of tiny devices and embedded systems. Successful deployment in this field requires intimate knowledge of applications, algorithms, hardware, and software.

I’m grateful for these two years away from home, I learned how to articulate my ideas, and discipline myself, and express my thinking. This time also taught me how much importance of math, physics, and computer science foundation knowledge. One of the most important of my life to learn to be part of a team with many excellent, and diverse friends from different countries.

I also grateful to thank my advisor Dr. Chung, Chi-Chung provided a rich experience from teaching to engineering skills.

## B.S  in Earth Science, earned July/2017

During these four years in the Earth and Planetary Sciences field, I learned how to investigate and gain my experience in encompasses a broad range of science disciplines and applications to environmental and economic endeavors. I’m was lucky to involve in the development and application of new tools and technologies such as space probes and sophisticated instruments, as well as fieldwork in remote and challenging settings.
